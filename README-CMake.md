# SIMH Build via CMake, v4.0 - CURRENT

## Introduction

CMake is a meta-build system, that is, a build system generator for other software development systems and
integrated development environments (IDEs). This gives you a lot of choice with respect to your choice of
IDE and build system, such as:

  * Visual Studio 2019 ("Visual Studio 16 2019")
  * Visual Studio 2017 ("Visual Studio 15 2017")
  * MinGW Makefiles
  * Ninja build files
  * GNU Makefiles

Note, however, the CMake build solution is not intended to replace the existing SIMH _makefile_ or existing
Visual Studio solution and project files. CMake is just another approach to building and developing the SIMH
simulators.
